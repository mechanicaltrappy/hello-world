Ideas, etc.


Howdy! 
I'm Jaybaby aka Jordan. I love a good cup of hot coffee and trap music. 
I live on a 160 acre farm in Louisiana! I love raising chickens, cattle, goats, aplacas, pigs, ducks and anything else I feel inclinded to add to our menagerie. 
I am excited to learn Github and to complete a coding bootcamp I was accepted into!
